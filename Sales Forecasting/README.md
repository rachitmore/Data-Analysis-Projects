# Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project is focused on sales forecasting, a crucial aspect of inventory management, budgeting, and strategic planning. The goal is to analyze historical sales data and create a predictive model to forecast future sales. This helps businesses make informed decisions and optimize their operations.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes loading the dataset, handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation to prepare the data for modeling.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This section involves understanding the data through various visualizations and statistical measures. It helps to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the sales data.

- **Modeling**: In this part, different time series forecasting models are implemented, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and others. The models are trained and evaluated to select the best-performing one.

- **Model Evaluation**: The selected models are evaluated using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others. The best model is then used for forecasting.

- **Sales Forecasting**: The final section involves generating future sales predictions based on the best-performing model. The results are visualized and interpreted to provide actionable insights.

## Dependencies

To run this project, the following Python packages are required:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `seaborn`: For enhanced visualizations
- `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning models
- `statsmodels`: For time series analysis
- `fbprophet`: For time series forecasting (optional)
- `pmdarima`: For automatic ARIMA model selection (optional)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

\```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels fbprophet pmdarima
\```

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Sales Forecasting.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells sequentially to perform the data analysis and generate forecasts.

## Results

The final output of this project includes:

- A detailed analysis of historical sales data.
- Forecasts of future sales using the best-performing model.
- Visualizations of sales trends and predictions.
