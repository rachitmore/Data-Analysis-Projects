# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on social media data. The goal is to classify the sentiment of social media posts into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is widely used for understanding public opinion, brand perception, and customer feedback, among other applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

- **Data Collection**: This section involves gathering social media posts for sentiment analysis. Data can be collected using APIs like Twitter API or scraped from social media platforms.

- **Data Preprocessing**: In this step, the raw social media data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This includes tasks such as removing noise (e.g., hashtags, mentions, URLs), tokenization, stop word removal, and text normalization.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualizations and statistical methods are used to explore the data and understand the distribution of sentiments across the dataset.

- **Modeling**: Different machine learning models are implemented for sentiment classification, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and others. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings may also be used.

- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The best-performing model is selected based on these evaluations.

- **Sentiment Prediction**: The final model is used to predict the sentiment of new social media posts. The results are visualized and analyzed to gain insights into public sentiment.

## Dependencies

To run this project, the following Python packages are required:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `seaborn`: For enhanced visualizations
- `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning models
- `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks
- `textblob`: For basic sentiment analysis (optional)
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch`: For deep learning models (optional)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

\```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk textblob tensorflow torch
\```

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Sentiment Analysis on Social Media.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the data analysis and sentiment classification.

## Results

The final output of this project includes:

- A detailed report on the sentiment distribution of the social media data.
- Visualizations that highlight sentiment trends and key insights.
- A trained model that can be used to predict sentiment on new social media posts.
